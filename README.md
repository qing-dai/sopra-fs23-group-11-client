# Battleship Game - Client

## Introduction
Welcome to the Battleship Game project! This is a digital implementation of the classic strategy game where players engage in a battle of wits and strategy on the high seas. The game challenges players to strategically position their fleet of ships on a grid and tactically guess the locations of their opponent's ships.
